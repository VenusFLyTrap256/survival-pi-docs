## Lore and Tales

Bob was a kinsman of the people of the rising sun, who made a city far, far away from the troubles of the mainland. He was a farmer back at home, so he set up a farmer a little ways away from the city to grow his crops, but he provided most of the food for the people and kept close ties with them. He, like the others, feared any danger that might lurk in the far reaches of the lands, so he set up a fence around his entire property, similar to the city, to ensure his safety.

## Build Process

The farm was done almost 50/50 by a collaboration between Quesi and Venus! Quesi laid out the blueprints for the whole area and planted the field. Venus then built the barn, Quesi the farmhouse and the windmill, and Venus the silo. Quesi built the beautiful tree next to the barn, and then Venus terraformed the entire area; adding flowers, bushes, carts with haybales, animal pens, and much more; finishing the build and bringing it to life.
